# opti4Abq 2.0

An optimisation method in Python 2.X that runs on a set of abaqus models to minimise the difference (in a least square sense) between the FEA output and a corresponding set of data

The following Python modules are used: scipy.optimize, subprocess, numpy, and importlib if run with Python 2.7

Documentation available as submodule in ./opti4AbqDoc [note that the link to the submodule repository seem broken from github but works fine after a git clone --recursive] can also be found at https://www.overleaf.com/read/wmdrgnxkpghd
